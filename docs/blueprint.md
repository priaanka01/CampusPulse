## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep crimson (#8E001A) to convey both energy and institutional gravity.
- Background color: Soft pale pink (#F5E6E8). A muted backdrop evokes a sense of spaciousness and facilitates content legibility.
- Accent color: Dark violet (#301934) to provide strong but refined highlights, contrasting with the primary crimson without competing with it.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines and titles; a modern font choice lending elegance to headers; body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text. 'PT Sans' pairs nicely with 'Playfair', offering readability at smaller sizes.
- Use clean and modern icons to represent event categories.
- A clean, card-based layout for event listings.
- Subtle transition animations when navigating between events.
